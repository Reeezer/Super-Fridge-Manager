# Super Fridge Manager

Super Fridge Manager is a website designed to help users manage their food inventory effectively. The main objective of this project is to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for users to keep track of their groceries, monitor expiration dates, and reduce food waste.

The website offers a scanning feature that allows users to add items to their fridge by simply scanning the barcode or manually entering the product details. The system utilizes the Openfoodfacts database to categorize the scanned items and retrieve relevant information such as generic expiration dates.

By categorizing the foods and providing expiration dates, Super Fridge Manager enables users to stay organized and plan their meals accordingly. The platform also allows users to set reminders for approaching expiration dates, ensuring that they utilize their food before it goes to waste.
